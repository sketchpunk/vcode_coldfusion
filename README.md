#Visual Studio Code : Coldfusion Language Support
Just wanted to add support for Coldfusion on Visual Studio Code.
I followed the instructions on how to port over existing support into Code by using the [Yo Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/tools/yocode) tool.
Also followed how to port and combined [Snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/customization/userdefinedsnippets) with the Language support as a single package. 

Original Authors deserve all the credit for creating the original snippets and tmLanguage files.

### Language and Snippets
* [Snippets from TextMate Coldfusion Bundle Github](https://github.com/textmate/coldfusion.tmbundle)
* [Language and Snippets from SublimeText GitHub](https://github.com/SublimeText/ColdFusion)
